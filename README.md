# TTR Cheapino Setup
My vial configs for my Gallium layout using cheapino split keyboard. Also configs for illustrations that are done on keyboard-layout-editor.com

## ttr-cheapino-layout.vil:
Just my vial configs. Load this in vial if you want to try my same keymaps.

## cheapino-ttr-layout-VISUAL.json
My keyboard-layout-editor.com config. Load this json on their website if you want the visual that goes with my vial config. This will be changed a lot over time.

## cheapino-ttr-layout-VISUAL-TEMPLATE.json
There is no preset build on keyboard-layout-editor.com for the cheapino. So i made this. It is a blank template and you can start adding the keys that you like.
