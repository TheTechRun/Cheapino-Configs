# TTR Cheapino Setup
My vial configs for my [Gallium](https://github.com/GalileoBlues/Gallium) layout using cheapino split keyboard. For mod keys I am using the [seniply](https://stevep99.github.io/seniply) method because I dont like homerow mods. Also configs for illustrations are done on keyboard-layout-editor.com

## layout.vil:
Just my vial configs. Load this in vial if you want to try my same keymaps.

## layout-VISUAL.txt
My keyboard-layout-editor.com config. Copy and paste this into the raw data field (or Load the json) on their website if you want the visual that goes with my vial config. This will be changed a lot over time.

## empty-layout.txt
There is no preset build on keyboard-layout-editor.com for the cheapino. So I made this. It is a blank template and you can start adding the keys that you like.
